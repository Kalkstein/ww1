Tsar Ferdinand has always wanted to crown himself in Constantinople and now that we have reclaimed it he should be crowned as 'Basileus Rhomaíōn', Roman Emperor!"
 BUL_the_great_war:0 "The Great War"
 BUL_the_great_war_desc:0 "War now rages between the Central Powers and the Entente and already it is at a scale previously almost unimaginable. We are now at the crossroads, should we join the Entente or the Central Powers, or stay neutral and hope war will not impact us? We must now choose as this will determine our fate for generations to come."
 BUL_neutral_world_war:0 "Stay Neutral"
 BUL_neutral_world_war_desc:0 "While an immense war rages in the rest of Europe involving the German Empire, the Russian Empire and all the other members of the Entente and the Central Powers, we should not take sides as already the war is having a catastrophic and far reaching effect. We must hope that we won't get dragged in by one of the powers for if we do it might be the end for us."
 BUL_increased_armament:0 "Increased Armament"
 BUL_increased_armament_desc:0 "If we are to take sides in this war we must rapidly increase our armament projects as this war will probably require all our resources to win. It is essential then to arm ourselves and join the war on one side or another. Already both powers' diplomats have been flocking to us to try and convince the Tsar to join them. Surely he'll make the right decision and join the right side."
 BUL_defensive_building:0 "Defensive Building"
 BUL_defensive_building:0 "While we have decided to stay out of this war we aren't guaranteed that by any of the Great Powers, which is not surprising considering they are all at war, still one might try and suck us in, or even outright attack us! That is why it should be our top priority to build up defenses to repel any hostile invasions be they from the Entente or the Central Powers."
 BUL_world_war_entente:0 "Join the Entente"
 BUL_world_war_entente:0 "The world is in turmoil and we have decided to take sides, diplomats of both alliances flock to us to try and convince us to join them. While German rhetoric is swaying the Entente definitely has the upper hand with millions upon millions of mean all around the globe. We should then join them and prepare war against the Austro-Hungarians and the Ottomans!"
 BUL_central_powers:0 "Join the Central Powers"
 BUL_central_powers_desc:0 "While war rages all around us we need to make a decision: either joining the Entente or the Central Powers. The latter seems to have the upper hand and they promise us Serbian territory in exchange for support. This is an offer we just cannot refuse. We should then send diplomats to Berlin and confirm our alignment with our German brothers!"
 BUL_neutral_factories:0 "More Factories"
 BUL_neutral_factories_desc:0 "Now that we have fortified Bulgaria from outside threats it is time to improve her industry to compete with othre nations of our size. For fortifications aren't enough if a nation can't send troops to man them and troops can't man them without equipment which is produced by military industry, which can't be built without civilian works. That is why we must improve our industrial capacity."
 BUL_persuade_greece:0 "Persuade Greece"
 BUL_persuade_greece_desc:0 "The Greeks lie right next to us yet they have not yet joined either Entente or Central powers. We could send diplomats to try and persuade them that joining the Entente would be a great choice as perhaps they could reclaim some territory from the Ottomans or in exchange for help some of the Italian held territory could be transfered to them. We should at least try and get them on our side."
 BUL_rapid_tech_advance:0 "Rapid Tech Advances"
 BUL_rapid_tech_advance_dsc:0 "Having joined this war we are learning much from our allies and enemies alike, we should catalogue these things and then turn them to use in the war. While devastating, this war is definitely very good for technological advances, as for example the mass use of aeroplanes in warfare to scout, bomb and intercept each other or the increased use of machine guns especially on the Western Front."
 BUL_romanian_front:0 "Fortify the Romanian Border"
 BUL_romanian_front_desc:0 "The Romanians are very Entente friendly and they have been making advances leading most likely to them joining the Entente. It is quintessential that we fortify the border now, while we're still at peace so that when conflict does come we will be ready and the Romanians won't even have a chance at breaking through!"
 BUL_complete_neutrality:0 "Complete Neutrality"
 BUL_complete_neutrality_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have proposed secretly helping the Entente or the Central Powers, in exchange for land if they win. These are extremely stupid ideas as they could lead to all out conflict with the other side. Instead we have drafted amendments to our constitution ensuring that we won't even be allowed to declare war or support any sides."
 BUL_help_entente:0 "Help the Entente"
 BUL_help_entente_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have proposed that we send the Entente supplies and volunteers to help their war effort in exchange for land if they win the war. While some worry that this would completely oppose our ideas of neutrality others argue that we'd get sucked into conflict soon anyway and it is better to choose the side now that involuntarily."
 BUL_help_centrals:0 "Help the Central Powers"
 BUL_help_centrals_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have proposed that we send the Central Powers supplies and volunteers to help their war effort in exchange for land if they win the war.

 BUL_access_through_romania:0 "Access through Romania"
 BUL_access_through_romania_desc:0 "The Romanian government has been drifting towards the Entente for some time now, yet they have not announced any cooperation agreement. Opening a new front with [AUS.GetName] is critical to the outcome of the war, if we were to be able to negotiate military access through Romania, we could quickly open a new front to finally relieve the Russians and perhaps make a push for Vienna."
 BUL_war_armament:0 "War Armament"
 BUL_war_armament_desc:0 "We have joined the war and so far our forces have been competent, yet the war effort is now taking a huge toll on our industry and we now suffer from a lack of supplies. We could solve this problem of we were to invest more into our military industry and focusing construction on military factories. We could start right now by just building a few."
 BUL_preemptive_romania:0 "Preemptive Strike"
 BUL_preemptive_romania_desc:0 "We have now fortified the Romanian border, but it needs troops to man the forts and that is proving to be a strain on our war effort. We don't have enough troops to garrison the Romanian border and fight the war. The obvious solution to this is that we strike preemptively at Romania to secure our border to the north and link up with Austria-Hungary. This would relieve a great strain from our army."
 BUL_join_war_with_ottomans:0 "Join the War against the Ottomans"
 BUL_join_war_with_ottomans_desc:0 "We have declared our neutrality some time ago yet our advisors continue to pester us with requests to help one side or another. Now one of them has been bold enough to suggest that we go to war with the Ottomans. While at first this seems idiotic the Ottomans are extremely overstretched and if we were to strike at them now our generals say we could easily capture Istanbul."
 BUL_war_With_romania:0 "War with Romania"
 BUL_war_With_romania_desc:0 "We have declared some time ago our neutrality, yet we continue to see the missed opportunities this brings us. One of our advisors has recently suggested we go to war with Romania. This might appear to be foolish, but their forces are defending agains the combined German-Austro-Hungarian assault and we could easily take Bucharest in a matter of days. Who cares about our word of neutrality?"
 BUL_increased_effort:0 "Increased War Effort"
 BUL_increased_effort_desc:0 "We have joined the war on the Entente's side yet we still face some defeats do to our technological inferiority compared to our enemies. While the Bulgarian army is not necesarrily outdated, it lacks the equipment to take on foes such as the German Empire. We should invest more in technological advances to be able to compete with these Great Powers."
 BUL_total_mobilization:0 "Total Mobilization"
 BUL_total_mobilization_desc:0 "We have been at war for some time now, and it has taken a very heavy toll on our country. We now face a difficult choice: either we keep trying to win like this, or we change to a radical economic policy mobilizing every man woman and child to build factories and help the war effort. This would drastically reduce our manpower but it would increase our production and lower civilian needs."
 BUL_destabilize_russia:0 "Destabilize Russia"
 BUL_destabilize_russia_desc:0 "We face a huge problem to the east: the Russian Empire. It is the reason Germany couldn't focus it's full force on France in the first place, and it continues to assault us with hordes of untrained, underequiped men. Due to these extreme policies the Russian Tsar has become very unpopular and the communists have been gaining power. We could help by destabilizing the Russian Empire and ruining them."
 BUL_expand_military_industry:0 "Expand Military Industry"
 BUL_expand_military_industry_desc:0 "Our military is under supplied and our military industry is severly lacking. This is no surprise as we have only been independant for two years, much of which we have spent strengthening the state and focusing on production. We should build a few military factories to start the modernization of the army."
 BUL_prussia_of_balkans:0 "Prussia of the Balkans"
 BUL_prussia_of_balkans_desc:0 "We have often been nicknamed the 'Prussia of the Balkans' due to our large army in comparison to our neighbours just like the Prussian Kingdom had. Let us embrace this reputation boosting the morale of the troops, and hopefully one day sending chills down the enemies' spine knowing what they are about to face."
 BUL_learn_from_serbian_war:0 "Learn from the Serbian War"
 BUL_learn_from_serbian_war_desc:0 "The Serbian war was a great victory for Bulgaria, finally making the Great Powers recognize us as the unified Bulgaria we are today. The war did not go without it's own tight spots. We were caught off guard by the Serbians and we had no high ranking officers because the Russians had withdrawn theirs from our army. We should learn all these lessons to never repeat the same mistakes again."
 BUL_propaganda:0 "Mass Propaganda"
 BUL_propaganda_desc:0 "We are suffering a temporary low in civilian and military morale. We should fix this by building our propaganda around defense agains the vile Ottoman Empire, this will surely encourage civilians to help defend the Bulgarian motherland. Launching this new propaganda campaing could help improve our national unity and hopefully civilians will flock to the banners, increasing our manpower."
 BUL_train_army:0 "Train the Army"
 BUL_train_army_desc:0 "While our army is large it is sadly undertrained and not many have experienced wars as the last conflict we partook in was the Serbo-Bulgarian war in 1885. We should organize massive exercises preparing the new recruits for the horrors of war and making sure that they're ready to face the Ottomans best in the battlefield. This will also allow us to recruit new army trainers who have proved there worth."
 BUL_international_involvement:0 "Found the Volunteer Corps"
 BUL_international_involvement_desc:0 "The Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps was formed in 1912, it consisted of Bulgarians from Adrianople and Macedonia, regions which were then still under Ottoman rule thus not subject to Bulgarian military service. It even took part in battles against the Serbians in the Second Balkan war."
 BUL_superior_arty:0 "Superior Artillery"
 BUL_superior_arty_desc:0 "Many Bulgarian divisions had artillery regiments within them, they were older but still effective on the battlefield. We should make sure to modernize them and keep them upgraded within the constraints of our new army modernization programme. They could even compete with their Ottoman counterparts if they could be manufactored in larger quantity."
 BUL_start_coastal_defence:0 "Start Coastal Defence"
 BUL_start_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The Coastal Bulgarian territories are open to Ottoman invaders if they can get past our naval blockade. We must make sure that this never happens so we should begin a coastline fortification programme ensuring the entire Bulgarian coastline is secure. Securing a coast line will mean that we will have more troops freed up to fight on the actual fronts."
 BUL_early_machineguns:0 "Early Machineguns"
 BUL_early_machineguns_desc:0 "The development of machineguns is a major step forward as it has already shown in the Balkan War that it can devastate enemy troops by mowing them down by the hundreds. We must further upgrade this technology to play even more of a key role in the upcoming wars we will have to fight!"
 BUL_support_battalions:0 "Support Battalions"
 BUL_support_battalions_desc:0 "Our army has few support units, we must research more as no division can function without engineers or recons. Engineers have proven especially useful in the last war as without their help we could never have captured the fortress of Adrianople."
 BUL_qfr:0 "Quick Firing Artillery"
 BUL_qfr_desc:0 "An army is supported by a multitude of units: engineers recons, field hospitals, but most importantly is the support artillery. Every Bulgarian unit has support quick-firing artillery to help them while some even have line artillery. It is important we make sure these are kept upgraded and well maintained."
 BUL_improved_balloon:0 "Improved Balloon"
 BUL_improved_balloon_desc:0 "We currently only possess one type of balloon used for reconnaissance by air. It has proved useful in the last war, we should upgrade our balloons to be able to fly further and higher. The Germans have already experimented with dropping bombs from zeppelin balloons which have proved extremely effective. For now we should just focus on upgrading our current balloons."
 BUL_infantry_equipment:0 "Improve Infantry Equipment"
 BUL_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "A large part of our army still uses older infantry equipment from the 1890's. We must research new weapons and upgrades that the Great Powers like Germany use. It is essential that our army is well equipped with the newest rifles for our modernization to be effective."
 BUL_learn_balkan_war_1:0 "Learn from the Balkan War"
 BUL_learn_balkan_war_1_desc:0 "Our troops have fought valiantly in the Balkan War against the Ottoman Empire, they capture Adrianople and even marched upon Constantinople only to be interrupted by a warning from Russia stating if we take Istanbul then they will declare war! We must never allow ourselves to be put in such a humiliating position yet we must also make sure to learn all we can about our troops' tactics."
 BUL_field_hospitals:0 "Field Hospitals"
 BUL_field_hospitals_desc:0 "An army while initially strong can be overwhelmed if too many troops are lost and new replacements aren't at all experienced. To counter this we should integrate field hospitals within our armies to minimize casualties, conserve manpower and unit experience."
 BUL_early_planes:0 "Early Planes"
 BUL_early_planes_desc:0 "We have used some planes with mostly foreign pilots in the First Balkan War and they were essential to reconaissance of enemy positions. We hear Germany has been developing interceptors to combat reconaissance planes and bombers to bombard enemy positions from the air. We should invest in these technologies to make sure our edge isn't blunted versus other more advanced foes."
 BUL_zeppelins:0 "Zeppelins"
 BUL_zeppelins_desc:0 "Zeppelins have been in use for some time in some other nations' air corps' to drop bombs from extreme heights where interceptors can't reach them. They rely on hidrogen to fly and can go several hundreds of kilometers before needing to refuel. They are widely in use in the German military, we should also adopt these massive behemoths to spread terror among our enemies."
 BUL_fortifications:0 "Fortification Focus"
 BUL_fortifications_desc:0 "While our army is large and now much better equiped we still aren't ready for an offensive war. We should instead fortify our borders and hope a defensive war will exhaust our enemy enough that we can take the offensive sometime. Until then we should focus on building up our land and coastal fortifications to help defend our motherland!"
 BUL_offensive:0 "Offensive Focus"
 BUL_offensive_desc:0 "While many have tried, so far very, very few countries actually won major victories on the defensive. There is only attack, attack and then attack some more. Even the Byzantines tried to defend their territories not attack and they fell! We should focus on the army's offensive capabilities to make sure we achieve quick victory in any war."
 BUL_army_reforms:0 "Army Reforms"
 BUL_army_reforms_desc:0 "Our army has been modernize much but we must now restructure the army command, promote generals and make sure the army high command is capable at leading our armies. This will probably shine some light upon the lower rank yet capable commandants who can then help our war efforts from the HQ."
 BUL_mountaineers:0 "Mountaineers"
 BUL_mountaineers_desc:0 "The entire Balkans is home to a lot of mountains, and the Ottoman's main region: Anatolia is also very mountainous. We should focus on developing mountaineers to be able to combat the enemy in this sort of terrain, which can greatly improve our offensive capability."
 BUL_air_branch:0 "Air Command"
 BUL_air_branch_dsc:0 "The high command has until now been responsible for the army and the navy, the latter of which included the air corps. Now the size of our air corps has grown so much that a new branch of the military should be established just for it. This will enhance the potency of our air units, as well as unlock advisors and commanders for the air corps."
 BUL_wonder_of_flight:0 "The Wonder of Flight"
 BUL_wonder_of_flight_desc:0 "Man has always wanted to soar high in the sky like birds. In greek mythology Icarus tried to fly like a bird, but fell. Leonardo Da Vinci experimented with many flying machines. Now the Wright Brothers have created a machine capable of actually flight. This has been perfected by scientist from around the world. Now we could use this wonder to recruit more men for our air corps."
 BUL_air_doctrine_1:0 "Air Doctrines I"
 BUL_air_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Now that we use more and more planes in our air corps we should have our military theorists see if they can come up for tactics for our airplanes. Many aces have already achieved great feats of flight. We now only need to study these and come up with full-fledged tactics for our air units to follow."
 BUL_continue_coastal_forts:0 "Continue Coastal Fortifications"
 BUL_continue_coastal_forts_desc:0 "We have already begun the fortification of our coastline, it should be finished as while we have contructed many forts there are still gaps in our defences and the enemy could exploit these to attemp to land. It is then essential to redirect our workers towards finishing these defences."
 BUL_cheaper_weapons:0 "Cheaper Weapons"
 BUL_cheaper_weapons_desc:0 "Now that we have upgraded our weaponry we need to produce it. Sadly the Bulgarian motherland doesn't have all that many factories to spare. We should instead get the best deals with companies and try and reduce factory inefficiency to maximize our weapon outputs."
 BUL_improve_sf:0 "Better Special Forces"
 BUL_improve_sf_desc:0 "Our special forces while they are on the battlefield aren't used to their full potential. We could research new ways to use them and improve their combat capabilities. The state should fund these advancements so that the special forces can be used efficiently in the wars to come."
 BUL_enhance_training:0 "Enhance Training"
 BUL_enhance_training_desc:0 "Now that we have reformed the army we should try and develop better training methods for our troops. While many of our already deployed troops are well-trained battle hardened veterans, the recruits we're training right now to join the army aren't getting all they can out of their basic training. We should implement reforms to maximize the efficiency of training."
 BUL_advanced_weapons:0 "Advanced Weapons"
 BUL_advanced_weapons_desc:0 "Now that all our troops are equipmed with a good weapon we can take measures to improve these weapons' effectivness. New tactics and better infantry equipment can help us destroy our enemies. So let us research these new improvements to infantry weapons."
 BUL_more_airbases:0 "More Airbases"
 BUL_more_airbases_desc:0 "The air corps has gotten much larger sine it's foundation, and now we lack enough airbases to field all of our planes. Our advisors have proposed that we build new airbases to store them. This programme would result in more airbases being built across the country."
 BUL_heavy_aircraft:0 "Heavy Aircraft"
 BUL_heavy_aircraft_desc:0 "To combat such threats as bombers and zeppelins we should develop new heavy fighters that could fly as high as zeppelins and fly much further than our regular interceptors."
 BUL_air_doctrine_2:0 "Air Doctrine II"
 BUL_air_doctrine_2_desc:0 "As a result of war aeroplanes have developed much in the previous years. Most larger countries now have full-fledged airforces with hundreds of planes. This gives us even more reasons to develop our air doctrines to make sure that just because another nation has more planes then us we aren't overwhelmed thanks to tactical ability."
 BUL_fortify_capital:0 "Fortify Sofia"
 BUL_fortify_capital_desc:0 "Now that we have built up our coastal defences, we should turn our capital into a fortress so that no enemy may come near! This project while ambitious will allow us to fall back all the way to our capital in case of our army being severly outnumbered, since these fortifications would allow us to hold out for months."
 BUL_more_military_industry:0 "More Military Industry"
 BUL_more_military_industry_desc:0 "We are a little bit short on military industry, even with the infantry weapons costs reduced. We should build up our military industry a little more so that our arms modernizations can go according to plan."
 BUL_experimental_equipment:0 "Experimental Equipment"
 BUL_experimental_equipment_desc:0 "Many armies have been experimenting with new equipment like steel helmets and flamethrowers. We should start researching these to give us an edge over our weaker opponents. Firstly we should focus on steel helmets, protecting our infantry from debris and other otherwise lethal things."
 BUL_air_designers:0 "Air Designers"
 BUL_air_designers_desc:0 "The aeroplane industry has grown significantly since the first militaries adopt them. Many German companies now want to produce our planes for us. This is a great opportunity to get help from our German friends and support their companies."
 BUL_improved_fighters:0 "Improved Fighters"
 BUL_improved_fighters_desc:0 "Advancements in air technology have allowed us to start investing in new ways to improve our aircrafts' range weapons and agility. Now we should focus on these as they are essential in the development of a modern, strong airforce."
 BUL_foreign_planes:0 "Foreign Planes"
 BUL_foreign_planes_desc:0 "Much of our airforce is composed of foreign pilots, and planes imported from other countries to go with them. Bulgaria just doesn't have the industrial capacity to produce a large airforce and the resources to train new pilots to join the ranks. The solution to this is importing foreign planes and getting foreign pilots to go along with them. We shoul start with say Germany."
 BUL_late_aircraft:0 "Late Aircraft"
 BUL_late_aircraft_desc:0 "Aircraft have much improved since the start of the great war. Back in 1910 there were no fighters, just reconaissance planes. Now there are bombers, zeppelins, interceptors and even naval aircraft. We should more heavily invest in this industry to develop our own airforce."
 BUL_more_mil_research:0 "More Military Research"
 BUL_more_mil_research_desc:0 "The last few years have been dominated by military development, all of the Great Powers are increasingly trying to find ways to outclass the the others and in order to compete with them in this day and age we need to invest more in to military R&D."
 BUL_gas_explosives:0 "Gas and Explosives"
 BUL_gas_explosives_desc:0 "Due to the stalemate on the western front the German Empire was forced to invest into other methods of fighting namely gas warfare. This lethal new type of warfare consists of shelling the enemy with various types of gas to kill them off in the trenches. While these aren't very humane methods we should invest in these and smaller explosives teams to keep up with other nations."
 BUL_more_artillery:0 "Better Artillery"
 BUL_more_artillery_desc:0 "Now more than ever artillery is an extremely crucial component in warfare with various types of heavy, light and medium variants being developed. It is said that the Germans are even working on a railway gun which would be able to bombard cities from afar. In order not to be outclassed by our rivals we should also research new ways to use these machines of war."
 BUL_late_bombers:0 "Late Bombers"
 BUL_late_bombers_desc:0 "Warfare has now much evolved, with tanks starting to take a vital role in it. The air industry also has, with new types of planes being developed. A new type of bomber has evolved in some countries, capable of flying further than before and with an even more devastating load of bombs. Not developing one of our own would be foolish."
 BUL_late_cas:0 "Late Close Air Support"
 BUL_late_cas:0 "Not only has ground warfare developed into something new and never before imaginable, but the war in the air has too. New types of close air support planes could dive-bomb the enemy into submission, greatly reducing the reliance on it's much more expensive counterpart artillery."
 BUL_flamethrowers:0 "Flamethrowers"
 BUL_flamethrowers_desc:0 "Not only did the Germans develop gas warfare to break the stalemate on the western front, but they created flamethrower units as well. Infantry equipped with a long hose that shoots out gas lighting it on fire in the process. These units could devastate enemy regiments and so we should also develop our own variant of them."
 BUL_learn_balkan_war_2:0 "Lessons of the Second Balkan War"
 BUL_learn_balkan_war_2_desc:0 "The Second Balkan War taught us very much, in tactics and weapons. We should use that knowledge to our advantage to get back at those Serbs and win!"
 BUL_tanks:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 BUL_tanks_desc:0 "Massive armoured behemoths now roam the battlefield: tanks. These immense machines are capable of devastating almost anything in their path, they are usually armed with a cannon and are well armoured, but the female versions can also have machineguns against infantry. Developed to break the stalemate on the western front, it now ushers in a new era of warfare, and all will know it's might!"
 BUL_late_zeppelins:0 "Late Zeppelins"
 BUL_late_zeppelins_desc:0 "These flying behemoths have been even used to bomb London and now in this new age of warfare they still remain a worthy opponent although they are now very easy to shoot down as the new classes of interceptors can easily reach their altitude and from there all it takes is a few incendairy bullets. Still if we could perhaps upgrade them even further they could outclass the new interceptors and once again be a threat to all."
 BUL_navy:0 "The Bulgarian Navy"
 BUL_navy_desc:0 "The Bulgarian navy is almost non-existent, composed of only a handful of torpedo boats. If we are to defeat the Ottoman Empire our navy must be built up so that we can counter to some extent their naval prowess. To start a few dockyards couldn't hurt."
 BUL_engineer_academy:0 "Engineer Academy"
 BUL_engineer_academy_desc:0 "The first building of His Majesty's Engineer Academy was built in Varna in 1910, it provided the Bulgarian fleet with combat engineers. The engineers participated in the first and second Balkan Wars, and the Great War, mostly as minelayers."
 BUL_heavier_navy:0 "Heavier Navy"
 BUL_heavier_navy_desc:0 "To counter the Ottoman Turks U-boats and destroyers won't be enough! We must invest in battleships to destroy those of the Ottomans and cruisers to raid their trade. So let us research battleships before all."
 BUL_lighter_navy:0 "Lighter Navy"
 BUL_lighter_navy_desc:0 "While the Ottoman battleships would be most effectively dealt with by other battleships and heavy cruisers, but we don't have the time or the resources to do that. Instead we should buil smaller lighter ships, like destroyers to target their trade and submarines to attempt to sink their battleships. This is the most efficient way to deal with the Ottoman navy for the time being."
 BUL_battleships:0 "Battleships"
 BUL_battleships_desc:0 "The nation with the most battleships will rule the oceans. Battleships are now a sign of national pride and might. We must invest in these more heavily."
 BUL_submarines:0 "Submarine Warfare"
 BUL_submarines_desc:0 "A new age of naval warfare approaches. Already the Germans have shown what a submarine navy can do, and it's devastating. Submarines can sneak past enemies and when they find a suitable target they fire torpedos at it from under water totally protected while the enemy vessel sits, horrified unable to do anything. This is the most ideal way a nation with our resources can fight against bigger enemies."
 BUL_restructure_navy:0 "Restructure Naval Command"
 BUL_restructure_navy_desc:0 "Our naval command is a relic of a bygone age. We need to restructure it and move the high command to Varna, a much more suitable place then it's current location Sofia."

 BUL_maritime_special_schools_desc:0 "The Maritime Special Schools were continuations of the previously closde down Miner and Stoker schools. They were opened in 1912 and at first admited 34 cadets. There were mining and electrical engineering courses, stoker courses and helmsmanship courses, and another few were temporarily added during WWI."
 BUL_large_dockyards:0 "Battleship Adequate Dockyards"
 BUL_large_dockyards_desc:0 "We must make a choice between setting up more dockyards for smaller ships such as cruisers and destroyers or setting up less but bigger dockyards for battleships.

 BUL_light_navy_tactics:0 "Light Navy Tactics"
 BUL_light_navy_tactics_desc:0 "Since our navy is mainly composed of light cruisers and destroyers we should try and focus our tactical research on trade interdiction doctrines to make sure we harry our enemys' trade as much as possible."
 BUL_marines:0 "Marines"
 BUL_marines_desc:0 "Marines are useful for a variety of tasks. But mainly they can land effectively on enemy territory via the sea. This could prove very useful for us once we've established a larger navy as they can land anywhere. Be it the Ottomans we could land in Istanbul, or if the Russians attack we'll land in the Crimea."
 BUL_war_with_gb:0 "War with Great Britain"
 BUL_war_with_gb_desc:0 "For too long have the British ruled the seas! We have now built up a mighty navy, that can take on even the Royal Navy and we can now proceed to attack the English and show them that they are no longer the lords of the sea!"
 BUL_war_with_russia:0 "War with Russia"
 BUL_war_with_russia_desc:0 "The Russians have been friendly towards us previously but now with our actions in the Balkans they are angry. We should show them that we are the ultimate Slav nation! With our great navy we will destroy their Black Sea fleet and then we can proceed to land troops on their beaches in the Crimea. This plan will most definitely succeed."
 BUL_german_sub:0 "Submarine from Germany"
 BUL_german_sub_desc:0 "We should buy a U-boat from the German navy as we are now comrades and they could spare just one of their many hundreds. While this won't hurt Germany, it will definitely increase our naval strength significantly."
 BUL_order_cruisers:0 "Order Cruisers"
