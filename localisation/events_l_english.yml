 july_crisis.100.t:0 "Assassination in Sarajevo!"
 july_crisis.100.d:0 "Earlier this week, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Austro-Hngarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, visited the Bosnian city of Sarajevo. Today he was murdered by an assassin believed to be associated with the prominent Serbian Nationalist Terrorist group, the Black Hand. Although it is too early to determine the exact assailant for this murder, Austria-Hungary has wasted no time attributing the blame of the incident on the Serbian Government. How exactly they will go about dealing with this crisis is up to them, but tensions in the region are not expected to cool down any time soon."
 july_crisis.100.a:0 "This can't be good..."
 july_crisis.100.b:0 "How dare they!?"
 july_crisis.110.t:0 "German Support?"
 july_crisis.110.d:0 "After the terrible incident in Sarajevo, our Foreign Minister, Gottlieb von Jagow, suspects that the situation may soon devolve into a war with Serbia. While Serbia, and their ally Montengro are not of any particular threat to the Triple Alliance, he believes that the Pan-Slavic sentiments in the region may cause a greater coalition of enemies to emerge in the south, should there be a war, and it may include Russia. To avoid this hypothetical war with Russia, he suggests we pledge our support to Austria, in hopes of intimidating Serbia out of resisting whatever demands Austria-Hungary feels are necissary to save face."
 july_crisis.110.a:0 "Send the Blank Cheque"
 july_crisis.110.b:0 "Let's wait and see what they do."
 july_crisis.111.t:0 "Blank Cheque"
 july_crisis.111.d:0 "We have reports from German Diplomats that they will pledge unconditional support for what actions we decide to take in the form of a "Blank Cheque." The timing for this great show of trust is impecable, as we must act fast to save face, less we look weak against the lowly waste of a nation that is Serbia. Our Foreign Minister, Count Leopold von Berchtold, suggests that we use their support as leverage to make greater demands from Serbia. With the Germans behind us, they will surely give in to anything we demand. And besides, they'd be much more glorious in our Empire."
 july_crisis.111.a:0 "With German backing, they will have to give in to any demand."
 july_crisis.111.b:0 "These are modest demands. They ought to accept."
 july_crisis.111.c:0 "I didn't really like him anyways..."
 july_crisis.112.t:0 "No German Backing"
 july_crisis.112.d:0 "After making a diplomatic mission to Berlin, our Foreign Minister, Count Leopold von Berchtold, has returned empty handed, unable to secure absolute support from the Germans. While it would have been nice to have their preemptive support, they and Italy will come to our aid anyways, should the situation in the Balkans turns sour. Not that it'd be necissary. This will invariably work out well for the Austro-Hungarian throne in the end, though, since we will both be rid of a Slavic-Sympathizer of an heir, and we'll gain valuable land."
 july_crisis.112.a:0 "We'll annex the Serbs with, or without Germany."
 july_crisis.112.b:0 "Without German support, we can't be too outrageous."
 july_crisis.112.c:0 "I didn't really like him anyways..."
 july_crisis.121.t:0 "Protect Our Brethren"
 july_crisis.121.d:0 "The Austians have sent an Ultimatum to the Serbs demanding their full annexation and they are calling on us for our support of their independence. While we are not in the best position to invade the industrial powers of Central Europe, we may not have a choice in the matter. Our recent loss to Japan in the Russo-Japanese war several years ago was humiliating and we are still licking our wounds from that horrific display. We cannot afford the prestige hit from not intervening, our nobles would be up in arms and we may have a Revolution on our hands."
 july_crisis.121.a:0 "These are outrageous demands! We must Intervene!"
 july_crisis.121.b:0 "These are not our affairs."
 july_crisis.122.t:0 "Protect Our Brethren"
 july_crisis.122.d:0 "The Austians have sent an Ultimatum to the Serbs demanding the become a semi-autonomous puppet of the Empire and they are calling on us for our support of their independence. While we are not in the best position to invade the industrial powers of Central Europe, we may not have a choice in the matter. Our recent loss to Japan in the Russo-Japanese war several years ago was humiliating and we are still licking our wounds from that horrific display. We cannot afford the prestige hit from not intervening, our nobles would be up in arms and we may have a Revolution on our hands."
 july_crisis.122.a:0 "For too long have the Austrians been picking on our fellow Slavs."
 july_crisis.122.b:0 "These are not our affairs."
 july_crisis.131.t:0 "Austrian Ultimatum"
 july_crisis.131.d:0 "The Austrians have sent an Ultimatum to us demanding we cede all territory to them and be absorbed into their Empire. We can only hope for Russian aid, as we and our only ally, Montengrow will never be able to hold off the impending Austrian invasion. We could still try, and at least slow them down. But even if the war is futile, it may still be worth it, just so that future generations will never be able to call the Serbs cowards."
 july_crisis.131.a:0 "Resisance is futile. We must accept these demands."
 july_crisis.131.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
 july_crisis.132.t:0 "Austrian Ultimatum"
 july_crisis.132.d:0 "The Austrians have sent an Ultimatum to us demanding we submit to vassalization under their Empire. We can only hope for Russian aid, as we and our only ally, Montengrow will never be able to hold off the impending Austrian invasion. We could still try, and at least slow them down. But even if the war is futile, it may still be worth it, just so that future generations will never be able to call the Serbs cowards."
 july_crisis.132.a:0 "This is unacceptable, we must defend our brethren... at all costs..."
 july_crisis.132.b:0 "We will hold out as long as we can!"
 july_crisis.141.t:0 "Austrian Expansion"
 july_crisis.141.d:0 "After the recent crisis in the Balkans Serbia gave into Austrian demands and was annexed by the Empire. Austria-Hungary has successfully bolstered its power projection in the area and has left the Russians humiliated. While one crisis was averted another is brewing, another grows more tangable. With a strong ally becoming even stronger, many belive that for the good of world balance the Germans must be curtailed. And with the revanchist French, longing to regain Alsace Lorraine, the emerging navel power of Germany eyeing more colonies of the British, and the humiliated Russians, wishing to dismantle their rivals to the south, the threat of war may seem more imminent than previously thought."
 july_crisis.141.a:0 "An excellent show of German supremacy."

 july_crisis.150.t:0 "Crisis in the Balkans!"
 july_crisis.150.d:0 "The crisis in the Balkans has been rapidly growing out of hand and was thought (or hoped) to have peaked with Austria-Hungary sending an Ultimatum to the Serbs. But the situation has gotten even worse with the Austrians outright invading Serbia, and the war will likely turn from a regional conflict to a world-wide catastrophe unless Russia stays nuetral. There have been many conflicts in the Balkans before - most recently with the aptly named Balkan War - but never have they turned into a global event. Now it may be different."

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate.

The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

[Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either.

Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state.

Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads.

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed.

Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
