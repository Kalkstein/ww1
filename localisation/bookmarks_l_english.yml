 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Growing Tensions"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, the Franco-Prussian War has allowed Germany to become the leading force, creating a lust for the expansion of the Fatherland beyond Europe. Russia's industrialization has led to a mass influx of Leninist ideas within the nation. Britain and France prepare themselves for another next war in Europe, while the Ottoman Empire continues to dwell in a state of decay, allowing Italy to lay claims to the Ottoman lands in Africa. The Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia has caused lots of tension in Europe. Could this be the spark to light the Balkan Tinderbox?"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Over the past century, the glorious British Empire has spanned across the entire world, generating mass amounts of industry, trade, resources, and manpower for the Home Islands.With her massive navy to control the sea, and her powerful army to conquer the land, Britain is a near unstoppable force. With the most influence around the world, many nations have felt the touch of the British Empire, falling under her in ways in the process. However, they are bound to their tradition, and often stick to their conservative ways. Will they be able to keep up with these modern times?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the bitter loser of the Franco-Prussian War, France has been on the path to try and overcome German superiority in Europe. The loss of Alsace-Lorraine has created an influx of revanchism in the French people and the lust for revenge over the Germany. The continued economic and industrial growth has put France near the top of the major powers of Europe, the colonization and developement of West Africa and Indo-China grants access to a plethora of resources. France is soon to delve into a brutal war. Will the Third Republic be able to beat the threat on the horizon, or will she be overpowered by her enemies?"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Für das Vaterland! The German Empire leads Europe into a modern tomorrow! After their astounding success in the Franco-Prussian War, Germany has been the best industrially, economically, and militarily. Along with their success in Europe came the colonization of Africa and Oceania, bringing in an opportunity for further expansion. It seems that nothing can bring down the Kaiserreich!"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The newest major nation in Europe, Italy formed in 1861 under the current King Victor Emmanuel III. While weak militarily and economically, Italy hold lots of potential to become a strong nation. While late to the colonization game, Italy controls Somaliland and Eritrea. King Victor now sets his sights on Libya. It should be easy enough to take. Or will it?"
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nicknamed "The Sick Man of Europe", the Ottoman Empire has been in decline for the past 200 years. While losing their influence in Europe and Africa, they struggle to maintain what land they have left. With a bit of modernization, the Ottoman Empire may be able to return to its former glory."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The vast Russian Empire is heading down a dark path. With Tsar Nicholas II failing as a leader, Communist and Democratic ideas start to ake their way into the Russian people. While not fully modernized, Russia is still a force to be reckoned with. The beginning of the twentieth century is a time of great change for Russia. One simple event just has to start it."
 AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An empire of many cultures, Austria-Hungary has claimed much of the Balkans as their own. The recent annexation of Bosnia from the Ottoman Empire has caused much tension in Europe. With a plethora of cultures comes a plethora of problems. Separatist groups refuse to cooperate and are threatening the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, the Empire shall remain strong! Right?"
 OTHER_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Powder Keg Balkan"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
